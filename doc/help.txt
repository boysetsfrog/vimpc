 Vimpc Help

 Vimpc is an mpd client based around the vi/vim text editors.
 It features normal and command (plus searching) modes of operation.
 Motion will be very familiar to vi users however playback might not.
 In addition different windows/tabs may behave differently to others, please
 see the specific section for each tab if unsure.

 MAPPING KEYS
 --------------------------------------------------

 Any key combination can be mapped to any other key combination
 including to ex mode commands.

 To create a map, the command :map is used which will map the
 first key combination provided to the second one.

 i.e. :map FF :browse<C-M>gg/
      :map @ :set add next<C-M>a:set add end<C-M>

 This will make the input "FF" change to the browse tab, go to the
 first line and then enter search mode. And the input "@" will set the
 add position to "next" then add the selected song then set the
 add position to "end".

 All ex mode or search commands you want to execute must be
 terminated with <C-M>, <Return> or <Enter> otherwise
 you will stay in that mode, instead.

 If you want to make a key do nothing map it to <Nop>

 i.e :map <Down> <Nop>

 Mappable Keys:
 ----------------------------

 As well as regular ascii keys other keyboard keys and
 the mouse can be mapped and are described below.

    <Down>, <Left>          | Directional keys
    <Right>, <Up>           | Directional keys
    <Space>                 | Spacebar
    <PageUp>, <PageDown>    | Page up and down
    <Home>, <End>           | Home and End
    <C-x>                   | Ctrl+x
    <A-x>                   | Alt+x
    <Enter>                 | Enter key
    <Return>                | Return key
    <BS>                    | Backspace key
    <Tab>                   | Tab key
    <Del>                   | Delete key
    <lt>                    | Less than symbol '<'
    <sc>                    | Semicolon symbol ';'
    <F1>, <F2>, etc         | Function keys
    <ScrollWheelUp>         | Scroll Wheel up
    <ScrollWheelDown>       | Scroll Wheel down
    <LeftMouse>             | Since left mouse click
    <2-LeftMouse>           | Double left mouse click
    <RightMouse>            | Single right mouse click
    <2-RightMouse>          | Double right mouse click


 PRINT FORMATS
 -------------------------------------------------

 The song and library formats used to print the songs can be set using
 the settings songformat and libraryformat respectively. The formatting
 of these strings is based upon those of ncmpcpp.

    %a    - Artist or AlbumArtist (based on albumartist setting)
    %A    - Artist or AlbumArtist, but swap "The Band" to "Band, The"
    %r    - Artist
    %R    - Artist, but swap "The Band" to "Band, The"
    %m    - AlbumArtist
    %M    - AlbumArtist, but swap "The Band" to "Band, The"
    %b    - Album
    %B    - Album, but swap "The Album" to "Album, The"
    %t    - Song title
    %d    - Date
    %n    - Track number
    %c    - Disc number
    %N    - Song name. This is not the song title.
    %C    - Comment
    %l    - Duration
    %f    - Filename/URI

    $Axx  - Align following parts at xx% from the left of the screen
    $R    - Begin right alignment
    $E    - Add ellipsis for trimmed text (must be before right align)
    $H    - Toggle highlight color off/on
    {,}   - Will only display contents between { and } if not empty
    \|     - Alternative to use if prior entry is blank

The setting songfillchar is used to fill up space due to alignment when
rendering a song. The default setting is ' '.

 Examples:
    The default song format is: "{{%a - }%t}\|{%N}\|{%f}$E$R $H[$H%l$H]$H"
    This displays artist - title if they both exist otherwise
    displays the filename and displays the duration aligned
    to the right. The $H ensures that [ and ] will not change
    color when that song is highlighted.

    The default library format is: "$H[$H%l$H]$H {%t}\|{%f}$E$R "
    This displays the duration, again not highlighting [ and ]
    followed by a space, then either the song title or if that
    is empty the filename.


 MOUSE SUPPORT
 --------------------------------------------------

 Mouse support can be enabled using :set mouse

 The mouse can be used to change between tabs by clicking on
 on the name of the tab. Or to select an item within a window
 by clicking on it. Double clicking an item will generally
 do whatever <Enter> would do by default on that item.
 Double clicking on a blank part of the tab bar will
 open the window selection window.

 The behaviour of the mouse can also be modified using
 the :map command. See section (MAPPING KEYS).

 SETTINGS
 --------------------------------------------------

 To print all settings values you can specify :set with no arguments.
 Or to print a particular setting you can use :set <setting>?

 i.e. :set
         shows a window displaying all settings
      :set colour?
         will print either "colour" or "nocolour" to the screen

 All on/off settings can be prefixed with "no", to disable the setting,
 or postfixed with "!" which will toggle the setting.

 i.e. :set nocolour
         turns colour support off
      :set progressbar!
         will toggle the progressbar on or off

 Value settings are not toggled on and off but hold an actual
 string/number value.

 All settings support tab completion.
