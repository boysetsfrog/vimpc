 Vimpc Help

 Vimpc is an mpd client based around the vi/vim text editors.
 It features normal and command (plus searching) modes of operation. 
 Motion will be very familiar to vi users however playback might not.
 In addition different windows/tabs may behave differently to others, please
 see the specific section for each tab if unsure.

 MAPPING KEYS
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 Any key combination can be mapped to any other key combination including
 to ex mode commands.
 
 To create a map, the command :map is used which will map the key
 combination provided as the first parameter to the second.
 
 i.e. map FF :browse<C-M>gg/
      map @ :set add next<C-M>a:set add end<C-M>
 
 This will make the normal mode input FF change to the browse tab, go to the
 first line and then enter search mode. All ex mode or search commands
 you want to execute must be terminated by <C-M>, <Return> or <Enter>
 otherwise you will stay in that mode.
 
 Ctrl key combinations are mapped using <C-x> where x is the key
 
 i.e <C-D> to map ctrl+d
 
 Alt key combinations work in the same way.
 
 
 KEYS:
 
 As well as regular ascii keys other keyboard keys and 
 the mouse can be mapped and are described below.
    
    <Down>, <Left>, <Right>, <Up> | Directional keys

 PRINT FORMATS
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 The song and library formats used to print the songs can be set using
 the settings songformat and libraryformat respectively. The formatting
 of these strings is based upon those of ncmpcpp.
 
    %a  - Artist
    %A  - Artist, but swap "The Band" to "Band, The"
    %b  - Album
    %B  - Album, but swap "The Album" to "Album, The"
    %t  - Song title
    %n  - Track number
    %l  - Duration
    %f  - Filename/URI
 
    $R  - Begin right alignment
    $E  - Add ellipsis for trimmed text (must be before right align)
    $H  - Toggle highlight color off/on
    {,} - Will only display contents between { and } if not empty
    \|   - Alternative to use if prior entry is blank
 
 Examples:
    The default song format is: "{%a - %t}\|{%f}$E$R $H[$H%l$H]$H"
    This displays artist - title if they both exist otherwise
    displays the filename and displays the duration aligned
    to the right. The $H ensures that [ and ] will not change
    color when that song is highlighted.
 
    The default library format is: "$H[$H%l$H]$H {%t}\|{%f}$E$R "
    This displays the duration, again not highlighting [ and ]
    followed by a space, then either the song title or if that
    is empty the filename.


 MOUSE SUPPORT
 --------------------------------------------------

 Mouse support can be enabled using :set mouse

 The mouse can be used to change between tabs by clicking on
 on the name of the tab. Or to select an item within a window
 by clicking on it. Double clicking an item will generally
 do whatever <Enter> would do by default on that item.

 The behaviour of the mouse can also be modified using
 the :map command. See section (MAPPING KEYS).
 
 SETTINGS
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 All settings can be prefixed with no, which will disable the setting,
 or postfixed with ! which will toggle the setting.

 To print a setting you can specify :set with no arguments to see all
 current values or :set <setting>? to look at a specific setting.

 (without the preceeding : ). These commands can change mpd settings 
 such as "consume on" as well as vimpc specific settings 
 like "set nocolour".
